# CSS_HTML_ResponsiveLandingPage
Advanced CSS Landing Page with Animations and Responsiveness.
The goal of this project is to build a dynamic landing page that incorporates advanced CSS features like animations, transitions, flexbox/grid layouts, media queries, and modern CSS properties (such as custom properties, clipping, masking, and complex hover effects). It should be responsive and visually engaging, showcasing skills like clean code, UI/UX design, and performance optimization.
Fully responsive layout with breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Features of the Project:
CSS Animations: Using @keyframes for the fade-in and slide-up effects.
CSS Transitions: Smooth transitions for hover effects on buttons and feature cards.
Flexbox/Grid Layout: Flexbox for the navigation and grid layout for the feature section.
Media Queries: The design is responsive across multiple breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
Mobile-Friendly Hamburger Menu: A CSS-based hamburger menu that opens the navigation on smaller screens.
Hover Effects: Card hover effects and button hover effects are designed for a better user experience.
Simple Form Styling: Clean, modern form design for the contact section.
